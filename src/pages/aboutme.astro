      <p>Hello, I'm Demian.</p>
      <p>
        I graduated with a bachelor's degree in robotics and digital systems, where I liked seeing software have a
        direct impact on physical objectsâ€”whether through robotic arms, embedded systems, or FPGAs. Throughout my
        studies, I had the privilege of collaborating with people who shared my curiosity and drive to build, learn and
        try new things.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period, I got involved in engineering projects with robotics groups such as Vanttec, where I
        developed both technical skills and the determination to push through failures and uncertainty in complex
        engineering projects. I also had the opportunity to do a research internship at UIC that confirmed my desire to
        pursue graduate studies and specialize my technical knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        This interest in hardware-software integration ultimately led me to pursue a master's degree. I'm particularly
        drawn to VLSI design, computer architecture, and advanced embedded systems, and I'm eager to apply my knowledge
        while continuing to learn in an industry setting.
