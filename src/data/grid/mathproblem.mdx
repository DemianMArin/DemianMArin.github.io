# IMO 2005 Problem 6

**By Demian**

## Introduction

IMO problems have always been so daunting to me. This is my attempt at understanding the solution of one (I didn't solve it). But I'm proud I understood it and wanted to write
it in LaTex because it looks pretty.

## The Problem

<div style="width: 60%; margin: 0 auto;">
  In a mathematical competition 6 problems were posed to the contestants. Each pair of problems was solved by more than
  $\frac{2}
  {5}$ of the contestants. Nobody solved all 6 problems. Show that there were at least 2 contestants who each solved
  exactly 5 problems.
</div>

## My Attempts

The first thing that I did is try to understand this problem. This means creating data by hand (Figure 1 and Figure 2). What I mean is that I tried to find an arrangement
of contestants in each pair that will comply with the conditions of the problem. After doing this with 15 contestants, and then realizing that was to difficult. I tried to
do it with only 5 contestants.

Then a **realization** came. I don't need to know the exact arrangement of contestants in each pair. I only need to know the minimum contestants required for the conditions
to be true. So if there are only 6 problems then there are a total of $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ pairs. This means that if there are 5 contestants, then every pair should have a minimum of $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 5 = 2 \to 2 + 1 = 3$ contestants. I added one to the multiplication because the problems states that there should be more than $\frac{2}{5}$ of the contestants per pair.

In the case that $\frac{2}{5} \cdot n$ where $n$ is the number of contestants, is not an integer, then I ceil the result. So for example if there are 7 contestants then $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 7 = 2.8 \to \lceil 2.8 \rceil = 3$. So every pair should have at least 3 pairs for the conditions to be true.

Once I realized this, I started to find out if it was necessary for at least 2 contestants to have solved 5 problems, for all pairs to have more than $\frac{2}{5}$ of the contestants. I tried this with different number of contestants.

Table 1 has 3 columns. The first one has the number of contestants. The second has the minimum sum corresponding to the number of contestants so every pair is solved by more than $\frac{2}{5}$ of the contestants. The third one is a to show if this is possible with at least 2 contestants with 5 problems solved.

| Contestants | Min total sum of pairs contestants                                   | Pairs obtained by solved problems                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5           | $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 5 = 2 \to 2 + 1 = 3 \cdot 15 = 45$                | $\begin{array}{r l} 4 \cdot 10 &= 40 \\ 1 \cdot 6 &= 6 \\ \hline & \boxed{46} \end{array}$                                                                                      |
| 6           | $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 6 = 2.4 \to \lceil2.4\rceil = 3 \cdot 15 = 45$    | $\begin{array}{r l} 2 \cdot 10 &= 20 \\ 4 \cdot 6 &= 24 \\ \hline & 44 \end{array}$ $\begin{array}{r l} 3 \cdot 10 &= 30 \\ 3 \cdot 6 &= 18 \\ \hline & \boxed{48} \end{array}$ |
| 7           | $\frac{2}{5} \cdot 7 = 2.8 \to \lceil2.8\rceil=3 \to 3\cdot 15 = 45$ | $\begin{array}{r l} 1 \cdot 10 &= 10 \\ 6 \cdot 6 &= 36 \\ \hline & \boxed{46} \end{array}$                                                                                     |

_Table 1: Checking if 2 contestants with 5 problems solved is necessary_

In the third column the result of $\frac{2}{5} \cdot n$ is multiplied by 15, because there are $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ pairs that can be formed from 6 problems. The numbers $10, 6$ come from $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ and $\binom{4}{2} = 6$, these are the total number of pairs formed by 5 and 4 solved problems.

But when the contestants are 7, I could get a higher number of pairs (46) than the required (45), with only one contestant having solved 5 problems. I also did this with 12 contestants but it is hard to create that table in LaTeX, but it can be seen in Figure 3.

## Solutions

So once I found that I could have more than the minimum required sum of pairs with only 1 contestant, I thought I had solved the problem. Because I just showed a counterexample. But I did wonder why it happened with some number of contestants. Little did I know that in the solutions I saw there was some trouble when trying to prove it for the case when the number of participants was in the form of $5k + 2$. And I thought it was because in this case it wasn't necessary for at least 2 participants to have solved 5 problems.

### Solution 1

The first solution that I understood—kind of—and that was the most straight forward (although maybe cumbersome) was given by Manuel in the AoPS community.

First he sets some nomenclature, $n$ is the total number of contestants, $c$ contestants who solved at most 4 problems and $k$ the number of contestants that solved exactly 5 problems. Then he gets an expression for the sum of the total number of pairs solved by each contestant—which he named _trios_. This is similar to the idea I had of not being necessary to know the contestants of each pair. The expression is

$$
  \begin{align}
    \binom{4}{2}\, c+ \binom{5}{2}\, k &= 6c+10k \text{ trios} \\
    &\to 6c + 6k + 4k \\
    &\to 6(c+k) + 4k \\
    &\to 6n + 4k
  \end{align}
$$

First he proves why there needs to be at least 2 contestants with 5 problems solved for the cases where $n$ is not of the form $5k+2$.

#### Case $n = 5p + 1$

Since every pair has more than $\frac{2}{5}n$ trios. Every pair in this case has

$$
  \begin{align}
    \frac{2}{5}(5p+1) &\to 2p+\frac{2}{5} \to \lceil2p+\frac{2}{5}\rceil \to 2p+1 \text{ trios}
  \end{align}
$$

Then the total amount of trios is

$$
  \begin{align}
    15(2p+1) \to 30p+15
  \end{align}
$$

Putting the expression in terms of n

$$
  \begin{gather}
    p=\frac{n-1}{5}\\
    30\left(\frac{n-1}{5}\right)+15 \Rightarrow 6(n-1)+15 \Rightarrow 6n-6+15 \Rightarrow 6n+9
  \end{gather}
$$

Since we know that the total number of trios in general is $6n+4k$

$$
  \begin{gather}
    6n+4k \geq 6n+9 \\
    \Rightarrow k\geq3
  \end{gather}
$$

The same argument applies for cases:

- $n = 5p$
- $n = 5p+3$
- $n = 5p+4$

But something happens with case $n=5p+2$. He gets $k\geq1$, which does not tell me that it is necessary for 2 contestants to have solved 5 problems. So we have to prove this last case for the problem to be solved. The way he goes about this is with a proof by contradiction.

He then assumes that $5p+1$ contestants solved 4 problems and $1$ solved 5. Then he also gets the total number of trios which is

$$
  \begin{gather}
    6(5p+1) + 10 = 30p+16 \\
    \text{6 because of }\binom{4}{2}\text{ and 10 because of }\binom{5}{2}
  \end{gather}
$$

Then he gives out this information. For 14 pairs the number of trios will be $2p+1$ and for 1 pair it will be $2p+2$. And if you multiply and add it indeed gives $30p+16$. But it is an arbitrary piece of information to give away.

Then what he does, which seems to me kind of arbitrary is he starts to count the trios in which each problem appears. Which is kind of random to think about it at this moment, at least for me, I had to do it by hand to get a feeling of what he was doing (Figure 4). It does help to solve the problem, but I find it weird. Anyway to do this he says that for 4 problems the number of trios in which they will appear will be

$$
  \begin{gather}
    5(2p+1) = 10p+5
  \end{gather}
$$

And for 2 problems it will be

$$
  \begin{gather}
    4(2p+1) + 2p +2 = 10p + 6
  \end{gather}
$$

Now if you're like me. You're wondering why would he multiply times 5 for 4 problems and for 2 problems he multiplies times 4 and adds $2p + 2$. For the first 4 cases there is clear explanation, at least for me. Every problem is in 5 pairs, and every pair has $2p+1$ trios, so to now in how many trios a problem will appear you just have to multiply this two.

But for the remaining 2 problems the way I understood it is a probably done by force, like it's not very clear (I don't know if that made sense). So he multiplies by 4 because there is one pair that has $2p+2$. That does make sense, but what wasn't clear to me is, why would it have to be only with 2 problems...Now that I'm writing this it makes so much sense, it is because that pair is formed by 2 problems, so that pair that has $2p+2$ trios has to be taken into account separately from the pairs that have $2p+1$¹.

¹ The other way I convinced myself that this made sense was to add all the trios in which all the problems would appear. So if there are $30p +16$ trios and I multiply by 2 it will give me the total number of trios in which all the problems appear. And this is because if all the trios are formed by problems (1,2) then the 1 will appear in 30p+16 trios and so does the 2. And even though all the trios are not (1,2) the sum is the same.

Then what he does is that he arranges the number of trios per problem in this manner

| problem | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| trio a₁ | 4   | 4   | 4   | 4   | 4   | 0   |
| a₂      | 3   | 3   | 3   | 3   | 0   | 0   |
| ⋮       | ⋮   | ⋮   | ⋮   | ⋮   | ⋮   | ⋮   |

He assumes WLOG that the contestant that solved 1,2,3,4,5. So the number of trios in that first row is equal to 4, because the problem each problem can form 4 pairs. For example 1 can be (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). And the other contestants can only have 3 trios per problem because they only solved 4 problems (He is also assuming that everyone solved 4 problems). So now what we have here is that 5 columns will have the form $4i+3$ $\forall\, i \in \mathbb{Z}$ $\cup \{0\}$². But in these columns one is of the form $10p+6$ and the others are of the form $10p+5$, which means they differ by one, but that is impossible. This $4i+3$ tells us that they must differ by at least 3. We have arrived to a contradiction. So the assumption that only contestant solved 5 problems is false.

² Wanted to add fancy symbols. I think integers include the zero. This means that $i$ can be any integer including 0.

## Notes

- So right now I'm going to try to write in LaTeX what I've done by hand in my iPad. The main objective is to write what I don't understand. Because my attempts to solve this problem have shown me that the solutions that I've seen in the internet are wrong. But almost all solutions in the internet say that I'm wrong.
- I've checked more carefully the solutions and I think I know what I was missing. The solution that I felt I understood better, still has some steps that I'm not comfortable with.
