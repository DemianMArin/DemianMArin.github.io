# Control Systems - Vehicle Speed Modeling

## Overview

This project focused on developing a system identification model for an autonomous electric vehicle using ARX (AutoRegressive with eXogenous input)
methodology. The main objective was to obtain a transfer function that accurately describes the vehicle's dynamic behavior
through controlled experiments.

## Methodology

I built an electric vehicle equipped with encoders, infrared sensors for line following, and a data acquisition system using
Arduino and ESP8266. The vehicle collected speed, time, and PWM input data while following a predefined path.
Two main experiments were conducted: step response testing and PRBS (Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence) testing to capture the
system's behavior under different input conditions.

The collected data was processed in MATLAB to generate ARX models, with correlation coefficients calculated to validate model accuracy.
The step response experiment achieved an R² of 0.9396, indicating excellent model fidelity, while the PRBS test
yielded R² = 0.7113.

## Impact

This project served as an excellent introduction to feedback control systems and system identification techniques.
It demonstrated how experimental data can be used to create mathematical models that accurately represent
real-world system behavior, providing the foundation for implementing effective PID control strategies using methods
like Ziegler-Nichols tuning.
