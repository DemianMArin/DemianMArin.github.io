# UUV Overview

    I was part of a robotics group called VantTec, where I participated mainly in the UUV (Unmanned Underwater Vehicle) and USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle) projects. In the 
    video, you can see me testing the communication between the Ground Station (my computer), Jetson, and the STM, as well as testing if the motors were correctly working.

    This was incredibly challenging since I arrived knowing very little about the standards and inner workings of the PCBs, embedded systems, or previously created ROS libraries. It
    involved a lot of trial and error, and I frequently asked previous VantTec members for guidance.

I had to do a bit of everything: soldering, low-level programming (with the STM), high-level programming (ROS), and understanding how the physical model described the UUV's behavior. In another video, you can see how the team and I submerged it in the water
to test buoyancy and ensure it had no leaks. It was incredibly fun! I also applied epoxy to the penetrators to secure the cables and assembled everything, which was particularly challenging due to the sharp edges of the shell. You also had to turn the shell
completely upside down so the electronics enclosure could slide in.

It was clear the design had never been physically built and was only tested in simulation, because assembling it was very cumbersome. Despite this, it was one of the best engineering experiences
I've ever had. It taught me why engineers do what they do and what it takes to accomplish it.

## USV Experience

I was also part of the USV team, though in a smaller capacity. I was there to support the electronics team (although I would help with almost anything they would need).

I had the opportunity to go to Sarasota, Florida for RoboBoat to help the USV team. It was a mix of feelingsâ€”even though we didn't achieve the results
we expected, I absolutely loved the energy and pure passion I felt in that environment. It also showed me how important hardware is. As Bill Porter said, "**Software** will win you the competition
but **hardware** will lose it for you."
