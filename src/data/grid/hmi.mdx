# HMI - SLAM in LCD with FPGA

    ## Overview

    This project is a real-time video streaming system that displays images from a PC or Jetson device on a compact LCD screen using an FPGA. The goal was to
    create an HMI for our robot. The robot would be performing a SLAM and this HMI allowed for a real time display of the map created.

    ### Hardware Components

    - **TangNano FPGA**:
    - **240×128 LCD Display**
    - **FTDI USB-to-UART Converter**: Interface bridge between PC and FPGA

    ## Specifications

    - **PWM Generator**: Control Servo
    - **Display Resolution**: 240 × 128 pixels
    - **Color Depth**: 2-bit (4 colors total)
    - **Data per Frame**: 61,440 bits
    - **Communication Speed**: 115,200 bps
    - **Theoretical FPS**: ~1.9 FPS

The actual bottleneck for this was the FPGA UART speed. The FTDI could handle 1M bps. But the TangNano's UART stopped working after 300k bps. By trial and error
the bps that worked better was 115.2k bps. There was also a problem of noise that could have been solved with better error correction code and some capacitors.
