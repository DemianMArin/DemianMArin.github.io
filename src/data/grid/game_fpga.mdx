# Cross the Road on FPGA

## Overview

    This was my first introduction to Hardware Design. I got to build multiplexers, FSMs, and eventually a very small video game/simulation. What I really loved about this project was experimenting with the VGA connector of the DE10-Lite board. It gave me a 
    glimpse into how graphics cards actually work. In this project, the graphics were pretty hardcoded.

    I remember trying to draw a circle that could be scaled up and down. In the end, I calculated the sin and cos values and ended up with just a single-size
    circle. It was such a fun experience and a great introduction to FPGAs. Quartus was incredibly complex and way too big for my Mac,
    which wasn't even supported anyway.
