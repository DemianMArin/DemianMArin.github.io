    ## Overview

    This project was an exciting challenge that involved all of my embedded and electronics skills. It made me realize what I'm capable
    of and also that I still have a lot to learn.

    ## Project Goals

    The goal was to create an autonomous vehicle simulating what a tractor would do in a field. It would receive waypoints
    generated from predefined paths. This challenge involved setting up PWM, encoders, an IMU, and a guidance algorithm. It was
    a very comprehensive project.

    ## Challenges Faced

    We encountered several challenges with the hardware. The MPU9250 had significant drift issues, the
    camera that was supposed to give us our robot's position would sometimes fail, and our ESC would occasionally draw too
    much current, causing the STM to reset. We faced challenges across electrical, algorithmic, and embedded domains.

    Despite these obstacles, I believe my team and I did a great job, and this project gave me tremendous confidence and a broad perspective on what embedded systems
    engineering is all about.
