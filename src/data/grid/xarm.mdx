# Xarm Inverse Kinematics

    ## Overview This was a small but challenging project. My team and I explored inverse kinematics and tested it across
    different environments: first in Processing, then in ROS/Gazebo, and finally with a real Xarm. It was interesting to
    see how at every stage, as you approach reality, the smooth behavior you expected in theory doesn't quite match what
    actually happens.
